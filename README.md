"# BookABoat" 


##The Book-A-Boat app allows rowing club members to reserve available boats for use  

    * Boats are classified by weight and skill level
    * In order to reserve a boat, all rowers must be approved at that skill level or above (Coach determines rower's skill level)
    * Date/Times of boats can also be blocked off by coaches for practices and/or regattas

    __Future: provide means to send message to coach if crew finds any issues with boat__
